    "This tutorial serves as a complete example on how to collect and analyze data from perceptual experiments using AEPsych. For more information on AEPsych, refer to the documentation in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych). \n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates how to create an experiment to measure one's detection threshold for orientation. On each trial of the experiment, the participant is shown two gabor-patch stimuli, one oriented vertically (the foil) and one oriented at an angle (the target). The goal of the experiment is to find the smallest angle at which the participant can reliably identify the target. You can run the code blocks below interactively to participate in the experiment yourself, or you can simply view data collected from an example participant."

    "We tell the server what kind of experiment we are running by sending it a configure message (see the [configs folder](https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych/tree/main/configs) for some examples. The gist of the config here is that it is telling the server that our experiment will have one parameter called \"angle\", which will range from 0.1 to 5 degrees. (If you run this experiment on yourself and find that this range of angles makes the experiment too easy or too hard, you can adjust the `lb` and `ub` values in the string below). This experiment will last for 50 trials. The parameter values from the first 10 trials will be drawn from the [Sobol sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence), to provide some initial data to initialize AEPsych's model; the following 40 trials will be drawn from that model. In this case, the model will be a classification [Gaussian Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) (GP). \n",

    "GPs can be thought of as generalizations of traditional psychophysics models that can handle multiple dimensions and allow the response function to be nonlinear (for further discussion see the [AEPsych preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09549)). Furthermore, GPs can be used in conjunction with acquisition functions to perform [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)--that is, the model can determine which points in the parameter space should be sampled next to achieve some goal. In this case we use the [level set estimation](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/202.pdf) function to find the angle at which the participant will correctly identify the target 75% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPs are defined by a mean function and covariance function. Because we don't define what these functions should be in the config, they revert to their default values of a constant mean function, and a [radial basis covariance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function). These functions are fine for parameter space we want to explore here, but if we wanted to expand our search across a larger range of angles, we would probably want to use a periodic covariance function to account for that fact that angles loop every 360 degrees."

The orange horizontal line represents the participant's detection threshold, which once again is defined as the smallest angle at which the participant would select the target 75% of the time. If you are viewing the data from the example participant, you will see that their threshold is somewhere between about 0.5 and 1.5 degrees (note, however, that threshold estimation for non-monotonic models may not always be accurate; we are working on better algorithms for this). More data could be collected to reduce this uncertainty. If you collected data on your own data, your plot may look different; there are often large individual differences in psychophysics tasks. In any case you should see that most of the sampled points are near the estimated threshold; the level set estimation algorithm intelligently selects points so that time is not wasted collecting data at points far away from the threshold, allowing for a more accurate threshold estimate in fewer trials than traditional methods.\n",

If you need any help debugging or setting up your experiment, you can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych/issues). You can also try conducting AEPsych experiments without writing any code, by running [this notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych/blob/main/examples/Interactive_AEPsych.ipynb)."
