abstract = {As research on sensation and perception has grown more sophisticated during the last century, new adaptive methodologies have been developed to increase efficiency and reliability of measurement. An experimental procedure is said to be adaptive if the physical characteristics of the stimuli on each trial are determined by the stimuli and responses that occurred in the previous trial or sequence of trials. In this paper, the general development of adaptive procedures is described, and three commonly used methods are reviewed. Typically, a threshold value is measured using these methods, and, in some cases, other characteristics of the psychometric function underlying perceptual performance, such as slope, may be developed. Results of simulations and experiments with human subjects are reviewed to evaluate the utility of these adaptive procedures and the special circumstances under which one might be superior to another.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the efficient estimation of threshold are here extended to the problem of how best to estimate the slope of the psychometric function. An adaptive method is described for selecting stimulus intensities that are optimal for slope estimation. A two-dimensional array of probabilities of different thresholds and slopes is used to calculate the stimulus intensity for the next trial; this array is updated after the trial, using Bayes' theorem to incorporate information from the subject's response. The practical implementation and efficiency of the method are demonstrated and discussed. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{DiMattina2015,
abstract = {Recently in vision science there has been great interest in understanding the perceptual representations of complex multidimensional stimuli. Therefore, it is becoming very important to develop methods for performing psychophysical experiments with multidimensional stimuli and efficiently estimating psychometric models that have multiple free parameters. In this methodological study, I analyze three efficient implementations of the popular $\Psi$ method for adaptive data collection, two of which are novel approaches to psychophysical experiments. Although the standard implementation of the $\Psi$ procedure is intractable in higher dimensions, I demonstrate that my implementations generalize well to complex psychometric models defined in multidimensional stimulus spaces and can be implemented very efficiently on standard laboratory computers. I show that my implementations may be of particular use for experiments studying how subjects combine multiple cues to estimate sensory quantities. I discuss strategies for speeding up experiments and suggest directions for future research in this rapidly growing area at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. },

@article{Lesmes2006,
abstract = {External noise paradigms, measuring contrast threshold as a function of external noise contrast (the “TvC” function), provide a valuable tool for studying perceptual mechanisms. However, measuring TvC functions at the multiple performance criteria needed to constrain observer models has previously involved demanding data collection (often{\textgreater}2000 trials). To ease this task, we developed a novel Bayesian adaptive procedure, the “quick TvC” or “qTvC” method, to rapidly estimate multiple TvC functions, by adapting a strategy originally developed to estimate psychometric threshold and slope [Cobo-Lewis, A. B. (1996). An adaptive method for estimating multiple parameters of a psychometric function. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 40, 353–354; Kontsevich, L. L., {\&} Tyler, C. W. (1999). Bayesian adaptive estimation of psychometric slope and threshold. Vision Research, 39(16), 2729–2737]. Exploiting the regularities observed in empirical TvC functions, the qTvC method estimates three parameters: the optimal threshold c0, the critical noise level Nc, and the common slope, $\eta$, of log-parallel psychometric functions across external noise conditions. Before each trial, the qTvC uses a one-step-ahead search to select the stimulus (jointly defined by signal and noise contrast) that minimizes the expected entropy of the three-dimensional posterior probability distribution, p(Nc,c0,$\eta$). The method's accuracy and precision, for estimating TvC functions at three performance criteria (65{\%}, 79{\%}, and 92{\%} correct), were evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations and a psychophysical task. Simulations showed that less than 300 trials were needed to estimate TvC functions at three widely separated criteria with good accuracy (bias{\textless}5{\%}) and precision (mean root mean square error {\textless}1.5dB). Using an orientation identification task, we found excellent agreement (weighted r2{\textgreater}.95) between TvC estimates obtained with the qTvC and the method of constant stimuli, although the qTvC used only 12{\%} of the data collection (240 vs 1920 trials). The qTvC may hold considerable practical value for applying the external noise method to study mechanisms of observer state changes and special populations. We suggest that the same adaptive strategy can be applied to directly estimate other classical functions, such as the contrast sensitivity function, elliptical equi-discrimination contours, and sensory memory decay functions.},
