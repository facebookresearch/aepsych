**Description**

This demo uses the popular yanny-laurel internet phenomena to showcase AEPsych’s perceptual threshold convergence capabilities. The yanny-laurel phenomena was a viral sound effect that divided listeners into two categories: those that hear “Yanny” when the sound clip is played, and those who hear “Laurel”. However, the perceived word can actually be influenced by modifying the sound’s pitch. Here, we use AEPsych to test multiple pitch modifiers and quickly approximate the perceptual threshold at which a user switches from hearing one word to the other.
