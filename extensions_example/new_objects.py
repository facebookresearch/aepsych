Extensions scripts that can be invoked by configs to allow extending AEPsych's 
capabilities without changing AEPsych itself. These scripts will be invoked right at the
start of parsing a config. 

These extension scripts will be run by the server, thus must exist on the machine that
the extensions exist on. Extensions manipulate the server behavior, not the client. 

This example demonstrates how to add objects to the Config namespace such that they can
be used as other AEPsych objects are.
