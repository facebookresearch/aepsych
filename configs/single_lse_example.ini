### Example config for threshold estimation from single observations.

## The common section includes global server parameters and parameters
## reused in multiple other classes
[common]
parnames = [par1, par2] # names of the parameters
stimuli_per_trial = 1 # the number of stimuli shown in each trial; 1 for single, or 2 for pairwise experiments
outcome_types = [binary] # the type of response given by the participant; can be [binary] or [continuous]
strategy_names = [init_strat, opt_strat] # The strategies that will be used, corresponding to the named sections below

# Parameter settings, blocks based on parameter names in [common]
[par1]
par_type = continuous
lower_bound = 0 # lower bound
upper_bound = 1 # upper bound

[par2]
par_type = continuous
lower_bound = 0
upper_bound = 1

# Configuration for the initialization strategy, which we use to gather initial points
# before we start doing model-based acquisition
[init_strat]
min_asks = 10 # number of sobol trials to run
generator = SobolGenerator # The generator class used to generate new parameter values

# Configuration for the optimization strategy, our model-based acquisition
[opt_strat]
min_asks = 20 # number of model-based trials to run

# On every trial, AEPsych can either initialize model hyperparameters randomly and refit
# from scratch, or initialize them to the previous model's parameters. This governs
# how often the former happens vs the latter. Using the previous model's parameters is often faster
# (leading to less waiting between trials) but occasional refitting is useful for avoiding local minima
# in hyperparameters, especially early in the experiment.
refit_every = 5

generator = OptimizeAcqfGenerator # The generator class used to generate new parameter values

# The model, which must conform to the stimuli_per_trial and outcome_types settings above.
# Use GPClassificationModel or GPRegressionModel for single or PairwiseProbitModel for pairwise.
model = GPClassificationModel

max_gen_time = 0.1 # Maximum amount of time to spend optimizing the acquisition function each
                   # trial. Lower values can lead to faster trials at the expense of possibly
                   # sampling less informative points.

## Below this section are configurations of all the classes defined in the section above,
## matching the API in the code.


## OptimizeAcqfGenerator model settings.

# ProbitObjective; other objectives will be ignored. If you need to do level set estimation
# for non-probability quantities, try another acquisition function.
