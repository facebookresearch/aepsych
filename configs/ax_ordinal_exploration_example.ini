### Example config for ordinal (likert) data
# Assuming you are learning a latent value from k-point scores,  the
# only things that need to be changed for a
# typical experiment are:
# 1. parnames, lb and ub under [common], and optionally target.
# 2. min_asks under init_strat
# 3. n_levels under OrdinalLikelihood
